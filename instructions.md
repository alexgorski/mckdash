In preparation for this call we ask that you complete the following exercises and return to me no later than 3 hours prior to your interview. (please let me know if this is too short of notice and we will reschedule for next Friday)

*******
We'd like for you to solve the following questions to the best of your abilities and feel free to leave comments, where necessary, to explain some of the decisions you've made.

Have you heard of Lodash? If yes, great! If not, it's "a modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras." In short, it's a ton of useful utilities to extend the base JavaScript language for many sorts of computational operations to help make our jobs, as developers, much easier and fun.

We'd like for you to build some of the basic building blocks that many useful libraries, like Lodash, are built upon. Instead of importing and using Lodash, we're going to build a few of its features. The intention here is to test your comfort level with JavaScript and some best software engineering practices. 

1) Write your own _.each
2) Write your own _.map
3) Write you own _.reduce
BONUS) Write your own _.memoize

Please refer to the documentation (https://lodash.com/) if you need further clarification. Please keep in mind that many of these functions work for all sorts of data structures, so be sure to read the documentation.

HINT: These bits of code built upon one another.
